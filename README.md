<h4>Pull: </h4>
    * https://github.com/adwansyed/SpamDetection-with-Machine-Learning.git
    
<h4>Main Success Scenario:</h4>
    * Select "Training" directory -> ../data/train/
    * Select "Testing" directory -> ../data/test/
    * Results will populate
    
<h4>Future improvements:</h4>
* Bag of words bayesian spam detector can be improved by attempting other machine learning algorithms like K-Nearest-Neighbors and other frequent itemset algorithms</li>
* Increase training datasets with larger and newer datasets
